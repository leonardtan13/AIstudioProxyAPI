## Research Question
i want to understand at the end of each request, how does the clean up happen at the browser level. what actions do we post to clean up at the end of each request

## Summary
Cleanup is orchestrated in the queue worker after every request. Once a request finishes, the worker waits for streaming generators or non-stream futures to settle, forces the Playwright “Run” button into a disabled state if streaming was used, flushes any residual items from the shared stream queue, and invokes `PageController.clear_chat_history`. The page controller then carries out Playwright UI operations: optionally clicking the “Run” button to halt lingering output, clicking the “New chat” button, handling the confirmation dialog and overlay, verifying that chat content is gone, and re-enabling the Temporary Chat toggle. These steps ensure the AI Studio page returns to a blank conversation state before the next request begins.

## Detailed Findings
### Queue Worker Cleanup Flow
- After `_process_request_refactored` completes, `queue_worker` proceeds to cleanup without releasing the serialized `processing_lock`, ensuring exclusive page access (`api_utils/queue_worker.py:322-336`).
- The worker first calls `clear_stream_queue()` to drain any remaining entries in `server.STREAM_QUEUE` so subsequent requests start with an empty auxiliary stream (`api_utils/queue_worker.py:324-327`, `api_utils/utils_ext/stream.py:68-85`).
- If a Playwright submit-button locator and disconnect checker were returned, the worker rebuilds a `PageController` for the global page instance and calls `clear_chat_history`, covering both streaming and non-streaming requests (`api_utils/queue_worker.py:329-336`).
- When those prerequisites are missing (e.g., request failed before page setup), cleanup of chat history is skipped, preserving current state without attempting UI operations (`api_utils/queue_worker.py:337-338`).

### Streaming Completion Guard
- For streaming responses, the worker retains `completion_event`, the submit-button locator, and the disconnect checker. After the stream signals completion, it inspects whether the “Run” button is still enabled, clicking it if necessary to halt any residual generation, and then waits until Playwright reports the button disabled (`api_utils/queue_worker.py:256-287`).
- All button interactions invoke `client_disco_checker` before proceeding to avoid acting on a disconnected session (`api_utils/queue_worker.py:264-266`).

### Chat Reset Implementation
- `PageController.clear_chat_history` orchestrates the browser-level reset: it checks the Run button, optionally clicks it with a short timeout, and pauses briefly to let the UI settle before moving on (`browser_utils/page_controller.py:535-552`).
- It locates the “New chat” button, dialog confirmation button, and overlay using selectors from `config/selectors.py` (`browser_utils/page_controller.py:556-558`, `config/selectors.py:13-24`).
- If the clear button is enabled, `_execute_chat_clear` runs: it removes any lingering overlay backdrops by pressing Esc, clicks “New chat,” waits for the confirmation dialog, clicks “Discard and continue,” and loops until the overlay disappears, capturing snapshots if timeouts occur (`browser_utils/page_controller.py:586-675`).
- `_dismiss_backdrops` iterates up to three times, pressing Escape when transparent overlays are present to prevent click interception (`browser_utils/page_controller.py:677-695`).
- After confirming dismissal, `_verify_chat_cleared` checks that the last response container is hidden, signaling the chat history is empty (`browser_utils/page_controller.py:699-706`).
- Each step calls `_check_disconnect` to ensure the client is still connected; failures trigger snapshot capture but do not attempt alternative flows (`browser_utils/page_controller.py:535-583`).

### Temporary Chat Mode Reactivation
- Once chat history is cleared, `clear_chat_history` re-enables Temporary Chat mode by calling `enable_temporary_chat_mode`, which waits for the toggle button, clicks it if not already active, and verifies the CSS class indicating activation (`browser_utils/page_controller.py:574-578`, `browser_utils/initialization.py:650-675`).
- Errors in toggling are logged as warnings but do not halt the cleanup sequence (`browser_utils/initialization.py:655-678`).

### Additional Request Cleanup
- Independently of UI operations, `_cleanup_request_resources` cancels disconnect monitoring tasks, removes per-request upload directories under `UPLOAD_FILES_DIR`, and resolves outstanding completion events for faulted streaming requests (`api_utils/request_processor.py:411-441`). While this is not browser UI work, it runs in the same finally block that triggers the queue worker’s browser cleanup.

## Architecture Documentation
- Cleanup commands are coordinated centrally in the queue worker, which serializes request handling through a single `processing_lock`. Every request returns a tuple containing the stream completion event, the Playwright locator for the Run button, and a disconnect-check callback so the worker can manage post-response UI state. After completion, the worker flushes shared streaming state and constructs a `PageController` bound to the global `server.page_instance`.
- `PageController` encapsulates all Playwright interactions. Its cleanup routine uses selectors defined in `config/selectors.py` to click the Run button, trigger the “New chat” dialog, confirm the discard action, dismiss overlay remnants, and verify the chat area is empty before re-enabling Temporary Chat mode.
- The same disconnect checker used during request submission is invoked before each cleanup action, preventing operations when the client has already left. This combined flow ensures the browser surface is reset without requiring a dedicated action queue or background task.

## Historical Context (from thoughts/)
- `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-21-multi-process-coordinator.md` – Planning document about future multi-process coordination; it does not alter the current single-page cleanup flow.

## Related Research
- None located in `thoughts/shared/research/` (directory absent).

## Open Questions
- None identified for the current cleanup implementation.

Highlights:
- Queue worker drains `STREAM_QUEUE` and reuses `PageController` for cleanup (`api_utils/queue_worker.py:324-336`).
- Streaming runs include an explicit Run-button stop-and-disable cycle before chat reset (`api_utils/queue_worker.py:256-287`).
- Chat reset workflow clicks “New chat,” handles overlays, verifies content removal, and reactivates Temporary Chat (`browser_utils/page_controller.py:535-706`, `browser_utils/initialization.py:650-675`).
